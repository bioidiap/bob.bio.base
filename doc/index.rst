=====================================
 Resources for biometric experiments
=====================================


``bob.bio.base`` provides open-source tools to run comparable and reproducible biometric recognition experiments.
It covers the following biometrics traits:

 * Face Biometrics: `bob.bio.face <http://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.bio.face>`__
 * Vein Biometrics: `bob.bio.vein <http://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.bio.vein>`__
 * Speaker Biometrics: `bob.bio.spear <http://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.bio.spear>`__


Get Started
============

This package defines the structure of biometric experiments. After installing the necessary environment, you can try out a simple comparison between two (or more) samples using a face recognition algorithm from `bob.bio.face <http://gitlab.idiap.ch/bob/bob.bio.face>`__, for example. Run the following command::

  $ bob bio compare-samples --pipeline facenet-sanderberg me.png not_me.png

The ``--pipeline`` option indicates which algorithm should be used to compare the pictures.
The list of all available pipelines is available in the help text of the ``--pipeline`` option::

  $ bob bio compare-samples --help
    ...
    Options:
      -p, --pipeline CUSTOM     Vanilla biometrics pipeline composed of a scikit-
                                learn Pipeline and a BioAlgorithm Can be a
                                ``bob.bio.pipeline`` entry point, a module name,
                                or a path to a Python file which contains a
                                variable named `pipeline`.Available entry points
                                are: ..., facenet-sanderberg, ...


Of course, with that command, you can run every possible biometric experiment by *headbutting* the problem and executing everything by hand.
Or you could use the tools that we offer here to set up an :ref:`experimentation pipeline <bob.bio.base.build_pipelines>`, structure your data within a :ref:`database interface <bob.bio.base.database_interface>` and run a whole experiment in one swoop.
