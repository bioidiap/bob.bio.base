===========================================
 Running Biometric Recognition Experiments
===========================================

The ``bob.bio`` packages provide open source tools to run comparable and reproducible biometric recognition experiments.
To design a biometric recognition experiment, you must choose:

* A database to use for the raw biometric data and a protocol that defines how to use that data,
* A data preprocessing algorithm to clean up the raw biometric data,
* A feature extractor to extract the desired type of features from the preprocessed data,
* A biometric matching algorithm,
* An evaluation method to make sense of the matching scores.

The ``bob.bio`` packages contain several implementations of each of the above steps, so you can either choose from the existing methods or use your own.

.. note::
   The ``bob.bio`` packages are derived from the former `FaceRecLib <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/facereclib>`__, which is herewith outdated.

The :py:mod:`bob.bio.base` package includes the basic definition of a biometric recognition experiment, as well as a generic script, which can execute the full biometric experiment in a single command line.
Changing the employed tools, such as the database, protocol, preprocessor, feature extractor or matching algorithm is as simple as changing a parameter in a configuration file or on the command line.

The implementation of (most of) the tools is separated into other packages in the ``bob.bio`` namespace.
All of these packages can be easily combined.
Here is a growing list of derived packages:

* :ref:`bob.bio.spear <bob.bio.spear>` Tools to run speaker recognition experiments, including voice activity detection, Cepstral feature extraction, and speaker databases
* :ref:`bob.bio.face <bob.bio.face>` Tools to run face recognition experiments, such as face detection, facial feature extraction and comparison, and face image databases
* :ref:`bob.bio.video <bob.bio.video>` An extension of face recognition algorithms to run on video data, and the according video databases
* :ref:`bob.bio.gmm <bob.bio.gmm>` Algorithms based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) such as Inter-Session Variability modeling (ISV) or Total Variability modeling (TV, aka. I-Vector)
* `bob.bio.csu <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bob.bio.csu>`__ for wrapper classes of the `CSU Face Recognition Resources <http://www.cs.colostate.edu/facerec>`__ (see `Installation Instructions <http://pythonhosted.org/bob.bio.csu/installation.html>`__ of ``bob.bio.csu``).


If you run biometric recognition experiments using the bob.bio framework, please cite at least one of the following in your scientific publication:
